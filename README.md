# Hestia Apps Demo: Multiple Apps

Check out the demo at https://hestiaroom.herokuapp.com

Hestia is a web app where developers can quickly create and host multi-user and real-time web apps. Users can interact with a web app together in groups called "_rooms_". In each room, an instance of a web app is created, which can be anything such as multiplayer games, chat systems, and drawing tools.
