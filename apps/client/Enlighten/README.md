## Enlighten

A port of the webgame [Enlighten](https://github.com/LenKagamine/Enlighten).

Play the stand-alone version [here](https://enlighten-game.herokuapp.com).

This app uses `requestAnimationFrame` to provide smooth game animation, but also relies on faster ping to play than the other apps. Even though Hestia apps communicates with two different servers, the connection speed does not get impacted heavily (~ 10ms increase at home).
